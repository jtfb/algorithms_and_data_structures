    "Answering the question at the top, it's a BFS (or Level Order Traversal) as it traverses nodes present in the same level before traversing the next level. It works because I've tested here building an example from my tree. I'm using Breadth First Search (BFS) as I did test depth first search (DFS) function and it got me wrong answers when having more than one duplicate. BFS ensures that I get the duplicate value closest to the root first as BFS process nodes level by level, starting from the root. The \"visited\" set tracks all the values I have visited."
